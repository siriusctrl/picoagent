# AGENTS.md

This file is the operating map for agents working in this repository. Keep
product and user workflow in `README.md`, current tradeoffs in `docs/`,
architectural decisions in `docs/adr/`, and this file focused on navigation,
cross-cutting invariants, verification, and handoff.

## Source Map

- `src/agent/`: the single agent loop, run state, prompt assembly, compaction,
  and runtime-handle supervision.
- `src/model/`: provider-neutral contracts and provider adapters. Wire formats
  and authentication stay here, outside the agent loop.
- `src/tools/`: the deterministic built-in tool registry. Each leaf owns a typed
  compile-time `tool.yaml`; related handle, history, and graph tools are grouped
  by family.
- `src/storage/`, `src/artifact.rs`, and `src/trajectory/`: self-contained run
  storage, newline-visible transcripts, artifact preservation, and history
  access.
- `prompts/agents.yaml`: typed stable agent instructions. Dynamic prompt
  assembly remains in `src/agent/context.rs`.
- `src/config.rs`, `src/skills/`, `src/mcp.rs`, `src/hooks.rs`, `src/memory.rs`,
  and `src/events.rs`: runtime configuration and integrations.
- `src/cli.rs`: command shape. `src/main.rs`: headless composition root. Runtime
  behavior does not belong in either file.
- `tests/`: cross-module and end-to-end behavior.
- `docs/`: maintained contracts and tradeoff summaries. `docs/adr/`: durable
  decisions, alternatives, and consequences.

See `docs/source-map.md` for the detailed ownership map.

## Core Invariants

- Rust is the only implementation language for the harness. Root and child runs
  use one `AgentRunner`; a subagent is a child run, not a second loop or class.
- Keep provider wire formats and authentication outside the agent loop. Keep one
  deterministic, namespaced tool registry; MCP tools use the same `Tool`
  contract and cannot silently replace built-ins.
- Execute one assistant tool-call batch concurrently under one shared foreground
  window. Commit results in original call order. Promote only unfinished exact
  futures, without stopping or restarting them.
- A delegated child is isolated and receives its complete objective and
  task-specific context. Its run id is its durable identity; only its transcript,
  parentage, display name, capability profile, and open/closed lifetime survive
  the process. Activity state, followups, pending output, and ordinary-tool
  handles are process-local; do not add a second durable task authority.
- A complete newline is the durable message boundary. Before resuming after a
  process crash, remove a torn final record and discard an incomplete trailing
  assistant/tool exchange by matching ordered call ids. Report the lost
  in-flight work and let the model decide what to inspect or retry. Do not
  reconstruct or relaunch old activities. Open child threads remain inert until
  an explicit message starts a new activity from their remaining transcript.
- Keep `messages.jsonl` as the single self-contained durable conversation source
  in the declared `fiasco-message` shape. Persist exact provider-neutral content
  and exact function-call argument strings; parse arguments only at the tool
  boundary. Do not add a parallel metadata or reconstruction log.
- One execution lease gives a run one writer and any number of lock-free
  viewers. Every complete newline is immediately visible, so a viewer may
  briefly show a prefix of the final tool turn. A torn physical line stays
  hidden; semantic tail repair belongs only to the next writer.
- Preserve every large or binary tool result in full under the run. Apply inline
  and preview limits independently per result, keep artifact identities
  immutable and portable, and add asynchronous status envelopes only after
  payload limiting. See `docs/artifacts.md`.
- Keep prompt and tool-schema assembly deterministic and frozen per run. Root,
  child, and compaction requests use the same built-in schema set; compaction
  reuses the normal system prompt and never executes tool calls. Stable prose
  belongs in `prompts/agents.yaml`, static tool descriptions in leaf
  `tool.yaml`, and execution logic in Rust.
- Planning graphs are run-local files, not runtime state or a scheduler. Memory
  is user/project Markdown outside the live transcript, not a special execution
  subsystem. Both are manipulated through ordinary tools.
- Fiasco owns newline-aware transcript sourcing and command routing; fmtview
  owns terminal rendering, navigation, search, and event handling.
- The launch runtime has no security sandbox or approval engine. Tools, hooks,
  and child processes inherit the fiasco process permissions; never imply
  otherwise.

## Change Discipline

- Treat fiasco as an internal harness with no external compatibility promise.
  Optimize for maintainer clarity and fast iteration; do not add compatibility
  layers or generality for hypothetical users.
- Implement only agreed product behavior. Before adding a fallback, validation,
  persistent state, recovery guarantee, or new subsystem beyond the current
  design, discuss the concrete need and tradeoff with the user.
- For rare crashes, prefer one durable message log, minimal trailing-turn
  repair, an explicit crash notice, and model-directed retry over transparent
  continuation machinery whose external side effects cannot be made exactly
  once.
- Keep checks at real external boundaries and states the program can produce.
  Prefer readable modules over speculative frameworks or defensive fallback
  layers. Review ownership before growing a file already near 400 lines.

## Contract References

- Runtime, handles, and restart: `docs/runtime-model.md`,
  `docs/architecture.md`, ADR 0034, and ADR 0038.
- Messages, tail repair, and inspection: `docs/architecture.md`, ADR 0032,
  ADR 0037, and ADR 0044.
- Artifact storage and result envelopes: `docs/artifacts.md`.
- Prompt and tool assets: `prompts/README.md` and `docs/architecture.md`.
- Configuration, memory, and planning graphs: `docs/configuration.md`,
  `docs/memory.md`, ADR 0026, and ADR 0031.
- The ADR index in `docs/adr/README.md` is the authority for superseded and
  refined decisions.

## Verification

Run for every code change:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo check --all-targets
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-targets
```

For provider changes, run the mock-server contract tests covering streamed text,
fragmented tool arguments, error responses, and authentication refresh.

For runtime or artifact changes, also run a headless echo smoke and inspect the
run's `messages.jsonl`, `events.jsonl`, final output, and artifact metadata.

For prompt or tool-description asset changes, verify `cargo package --list`
contains every referenced asset.

## Documentation Routing

- User-visible commands, setup, or supported features: `README.md`.
- Runtime or module boundaries: `docs/architecture.md`.
- Artifacts, memory, configuration, and prompt assets: their matching documents
  under `docs/` or `prompts/`.
- Current tradeoff summaries: `docs/design-choices.md`.
- Significant cross-module decisions or rejected credible alternatives: add or
  supersede an ADR and update its index. Do not silently rewrite an accepted
  decision.

## Review And Handoff

- Report checks actually run and any provider path not exercised with live
  credentials.
- Do not revert unrelated user changes.
- Use Conventional Commits with a body explaining what changed and why.
- Keep generated runs, credentials, and `target/` output out of Git.
