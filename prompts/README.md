# Prompt Assets

`agents.yaml` is the typed registry for stable agent-level prose. Every prompt
is a folded `>-` scalar, so YAML removes source-only line wrapping and strips
the final newline before Rust sees the value. `src/prompts.rs` parses the
embedded file once, rejects unknown or empty fields, and exposes the named
prompts directly.

Runtime assembly, precedence, dynamic values, argument validation, and
execution contracts remain in Rust. Project `AGENTS.md`, model modalities,
runtime role, remaining delegation depth, skill metadata, memory paths, and
the delegated task text are dynamic inputs. Stable GeneralTask guidance lives
in this registry and Rust inserts it into the child's initial runtime reminder.
The stable system prompt defines only tool-agnostic behavior:
user-intent boundaries, evidence, schema authority, concurrent-call semantics,
instruction precedence, process permissions, and final reporting. Tool names
and feature workflows do not belong in that prefix, so removing a tool schema
also removes its prompt influence. The initial runtime reminder carries
concrete run state and concise feature guidance only when that feature is
present. Its child guidance points to the paired, self-contained delegated
task. Keeping the stable rules in the shared system prefix preserves
byte-identical Root and GeneralTask prefixes.

Every local model-facing tool adapter keeps a typed `tool.yaml` beside its Rust
module. Standalone adapters live at `src/tools/<tool>/`; cohesive handle, history,
and graph families live at `src/tools/<family>/<member>/`. Every manifest still
declares the complete provider-visible name rather than deriving it from its
path. `description` states purpose, usage, side effects, and constraints;
`returns` states the successful result shape, interpretation, and tool-specific
follow-up. The loader joins them as
`<description>\n\nReturns: <returns>` for the standard provider description. The
Rust module owns arguments, semantic validation, and execution. Domain state
stays in its subsystem: for example, handle adapters call
`RuntimeHandleManager`, and `load_skill` calls `SkillRegistry`. Other stable model
instructions live with the behavior that assembles them, such as
`src/artifact/model-instruction.md`.

When one call needs a structured aggregate rather than incremental mutation,
the manifest may include a concise representative example in both its prose and
JSON Schema. For example, `graph_init` accepts a complete graph document,
including any already accepted resolutions, in one call so Rust can validate
the exact persisted shape before creating the graph file. Examples explain
shape only; Rust remains authoritative for semantic validation.

These are compile-time assets, not runtime overrides or dynamically discovered
plugins. External executable tools integrate through MCP and keep their
server-provided dynamic schemas rather than using local manifests.

`returns` is required even when one short sentence is sufficient. A manifest
should explain its own behavior without assuming that a sibling tool is
available; cross-tool follow-up is described in capability terms unless the
dependency is intrinsic to the returned data. Generic artifact spill and error
behavior stays in runtime-generated result guidance rather than being copied
into every manifest. This authoring split does not add a private provider field
or claim a formal output schema.

Tool descriptions are sent through the provider's sorted tool-schema field.
Core history, delegation, and handle-control schemas are present in every Root
and GeneralTask run. Optional web or MCP capabilities are selected during the
single run-assembly path. Memory uses ordinary file tools and therefore adds no
schema. Remaining delegation depth is runtime state, not schema membership.
Compaction reuses that system/tool prefix and adds the `compaction_request`
prompt as the final user message.
Normal context after a successful checkpoint adds `compaction_resume` inside a
synthetic user runtime reminder immediately after the exact assistant state.
Every local manifest is static. Startup integrations may add complete external
or optional specs, but remaining delegation depth never changes built-in
membership.
