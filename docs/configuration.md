# Configuration

Fiasco reads TOML from an explicit `--config` path, the workspace
`.fiasco/config.toml`, or the user `$HOME/.fiasco/config.toml`. Workspace and user
files are alternatives in the launch runtime; they are not merged.
Unknown fields are rejected so misspelled settings fail at startup instead of
silently falling back to defaults.

## Provider

Exactly one `[provider]` table is active.

```toml
[provider]
kind = "openai-oauth"
model = "gpt-5.6-sol"
modalities = ["text"]
# base_url = "https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex"
# auth_file = "/custom/fiasco-auth.json"
```

```toml
[provider]
kind = "openai-compatible"
model = "local-model"
modalities = ["text"] # or ["text", "image"] for a vision model
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1"
api_key = "${OPENAI_API_KEY}" # or a literal key
protocol = "responses" # or "chat-completions"
reasoning_effort = "medium" # optional; provider/model-specific
```

`modalities` declares the selected model's input capabilities. It defaults to
`["text"]`, must include `text`, and currently accepts only `text` and `image`.
Fiasco does not infer capability from a model name or probe the endpoint.
The first runtime reminder records the declaration as `current model supported
modalities: [...]`, while the stable system prompt tells the agent not to use
an absent modality. If a text-only model nevertheless calls `read` on an image,
the tool returns an ordinary error before reading or attaching the image; no
multimodal provider request is made. The declaration is stored in `run.json`
and must match when the run resumes. It applies to the primary and optional
GeneralTask model selected by this configuration.

`api_key` accepts either a literal value or a whole environment reference such
as `${OPENAI_API_KEY}`. Environment references are resolved when the runtime is
assembled. Keep literal credentials in `$HOME/.fiasco/config.toml` with
restrictive file permissions rather than in a workspace config that may be
shared. If `api_key` is omitted, fiasco reads `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The removed
OpenAI-compatible `api_key_env` field is rejected; use
`api_key = "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"` for an explicit environment reference.

`reasoning_effort` is passed through as a string because OpenAI-compatible
providers and models support different levels. Fiasco maps it to
`reasoning.effort` for the Responses protocol and to the top-level
`reasoning_effort` field for Chat Completions. Omitting it preserves the
provider's default. Common values are `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`,
`high`, and `xhigh`; some endpoints support additional values.

For Chat Completions, setting `reasoning_effort` also makes the runtime map
`max_output_tokens` to `max_completion_tokens`. Without reasoning configured,
the existing `max_tokens` request field is preserved for compatibility with
older OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

For compatible Chat streams, `delta.reasoning_content` is captured separately
from `delta.content`, persisted as the optional `reasoning_content` field on the
complete assistant line in `messages.jsonl`, and replayed in that separate field
on later compatible Chat requests. It is never concatenated into visible
assistant `content`. `reasoning_content` is an OpenAI-compatible endpoint
extension, not an official OpenAI Chat Completions message field. Empty deltas
are ignored. If usage includes
`completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`, that count is written to the
`model_completed` or `compaction_completed` event for the corresponding
request. Responses usage reports the equivalent count under
`output_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`. Both completed event types likewise
retain provider-reported cached input token counts.

Some compatible endpoints omit the required id from a streamed tool call.
Fiasco assigns a unique `call_<ULID>` id at the provider boundary so the
assistant call and its tool result retain an unambiguous Chat identity.

This behavior only records fields the provider actually sends. OpenAI
Responses reasoning continuation items remain provider-owned items; the
runtime does not infer or expose hidden chain-of-thought.

```toml
[provider]
kind = "anthropic-compatible"
model = "claude-compatible-model"
modalities = ["text"]
base_url = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"
api_key_env = "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
# anthropic_version = "2023-06-01"
```

## Runtime

```toml
[runtime]
max_subagent_depth = 1
max_parallel_subagents = 4
max_parallel_model_calls = 1
model_stream_idle_timeout_seconds = 300
model_request_deadline_seconds = 3600
max_output_tokens = 8192
```

Normal and child agent loops have no model-step cap. They continue until the
model returns a final response with no unresolved background work, the run is
stopped, or a real provider/runtime error occurs.
`max_parallel_model_calls` is shared by a parent and all of its child runs; the
conservative default of one supports endpoints with a single-request
concurrency limit, while higher-capacity deployments may raise it.
`model_stream_idle_timeout_seconds` covers opening the HTTP request through its
response headers and the gap between valid SSE events. Its interval restarts
after every event, including reasoning, tool-call, usage, and protocol events
that do not contain visible text.
`model_request_deadline_seconds` bounds the full API call after it acquires the
shared model slot and never restarts. It includes provider queueing, reasoning,
streaming, authentication refresh, and compatible-endpoint rate-limit backoff,
but not tool execution or time waiting for the model slot. Normal and
compaction calls use the same pair. An expired normal call fails the run, while
an expired compaction call leaves the current context unchanged. Both parallel
capacities, configured output token limits, model timeout values, and task
wait/foreground limits must be greater than zero.

The OpenAI-compatible adapter additionally retries initial HTTP 429 responses
up to three times with bounded exponential backoff. It does not retry a partial
stream at the HTTP layer or a non-rate-limit provider error. The agent runner
does make one new request when a supported protocol explicitly reports a
structurally incomplete response; the discarded partial response is never
persisted or executed, while any provider-reported usage remains in its
`model_failed` event. Filtering, refusal, and unknown stop reasons are not part
of this retry path. A resumable run records a non-secret
fingerprint of wire-critical provider settings. Changing the compatible
endpoint, Chat/Responses protocol, reasoning effort, OAuth inference endpoint,
or Anthropic version requires a new run rather than replaying provider state
against a different protocol.

## Compaction And History Retrieval

```toml
[compaction]
# compact_at_tokens = 100000    # omitted by default: automatic compaction off
# context_window_tokens = 131072
keep_recent_tokens = 20000
summary_max_output_tokens = 4096
history_search_max_matches = 50
```

`compact_at_tokens` enables automatic compacted-state creation and must be
greater than zero. It does not enable tools or change the normal system prompt:
every normal agent profile receives `history_search` and `history_read` from its first
provider call even when the setting is omitted. `context_window_tokens` is the
model's optional nominal full context window. When both are set,
`compact_at_tokens` must be smaller, and `runtime.max_output_tokens` must be set
so the Root profile has an explicit output reserve. All limits must be positive. Fiasco
estimates system, frozen schemas, and active messages from the first request;
provider-reported input usage replaces that estimate whenever available. When
the tracked context reaches the threshold, fiasco uses the
same provider, model, system prompt, and frozen tool schemas for an additional
request ending in the `compaction_request` user instruction. A tool-call or
empty state is rejected and retried once. Every real request has a numbered
started event and a matching completed or failed event; invalid-attempt failures
retain provider-reported usage. A preflight rejection has no started event and
uses a null attempt because no request occurred. A request error leaves the existing context or
compacted state in use. Before each model call, fiasco adds
the configured output allowance and fails if the estimate is at or above
`context_window_tokens`. This provider-neutral estimate is a safety check, not
a tokenizer-exact guarantee.

`keep_recent_tokens` is the approximate size of the exact message suffix kept
beside the compacted state. It uses a provider-neutral estimate for choosing
completed message boundaries and keeps a tool call with its result. Compatible
Chat `reasoning_content` and replayable opaque provider items are included.
`summary_max_output_tokens` limits the compacted-state response.
A normal request with an active state inserts the stable `compaction_resume`
runtime reminder immediately after that assistant state. It is not persisted
and prevents the state from being mistaken for a final answer or a fresh
compaction request.
A fixed profile without both history tools and at least one of `read` or `bash`
would keep its full context instead of compacting without an exact-recovery
path.

Root and GeneralTask each assemble the same sorted built-in registry and freeze
it before their first provider call. `delegate` and all task controls remain in
that registry at every depth. Delegating and leaf remain separate persisted
profiles for recovery, but do not change schema membership. The exact remaining
delegation depth is frozen in run metadata and shown in the runtime reminder;
`delegate` returns a local error at zero. Compaction reuses the same schemas but
never executes a returned tool call. Optional `web_search` and MCP schemas
depend on startup configuration. Memory uses the ordinary file tools and adds
no schema. None changes during the run.

`history_search_max_matches` is a positive, per-query cap for newest-first
regex matches over messages removed from the active context. It is not an
artifact byte limit: matches omitted by this cap are not placed in the result
artifact. `history_search` and `history_read` have no cursor and never modify
the transcript; refine the regex or read a bounded window around a returned ref.
The local reader uses `rg` from `PATH` to scan linked full-text artifacts
without loading them into the Rust heap; message-only matching does not require
that subprocess. Remote readers may implement the same interface directly.

Compaction is local and model-generated. Fiasco does not currently call a
provider's server-side compaction API.

## Background Tasks And Agent Profiles

```toml
[tasks]
foreground_tool_timeout_seconds = 30
wait_timeout_seconds = 10

[agents.general_task]
# model = "smaller-compatible-model" # defaults to the primary provider model
# max_output_tokens = 4096 # defaults to the root agent limit
```

`foreground_tool_timeout_seconds` is one shared promotion window for all
direct calls in an assistant message, not an execution deadline per call. The
batch returns early when all calls settle. When the window expires, each
already-running unfinished direct tool continues as a background task and the
model receives a status-less runtime notice with its task id and name.
Delegated agents have no harness execution deadline. Each `task_wait` call
returns when any selected task becomes inactive or after at most
`wait_timeout_seconds`, without cancelling unfinished work; this value must be
strictly lower than the foreground window. `task_stop` interrupts a one-shot
task or only the current activity of a reusable agent; the stopped agent stays
idle and paused until its next explicit `task_send`.
`max_parallel_subagents` limits delegated child execution in one parent run;
already-running direct calls are not paused when they are promoted. On Unix,
cancelling `bash` terminates its process-group descendants too.

Terminal background tool and child results use the configured per-result
artifact limits just like foreground tools. Small UTF-8 output stays inline;
larger or binary output is preserved behind the bounded artifact envelope.

## Artifacts

```toml
[artifacts]
inline_bytes = 32768
preview_head_bytes = 8192
preview_tail_bytes = 8192
```

Each result is considered independently. Small UTF-8 results up to
`inline_bytes` stay inline. Larger results are stored as artifacts and expose
at most `preview_head_bytes` from the beginning and `preview_tail_bytes` from
the end to the model.

## Memory

```toml
[memory]
enabled = true
# global_root = "/persistent/fiasco-home"
```

`global_root` must be an absolute path and is the base containing
`memory/user/`. A relative `FIASCO_HOME` environment value is resolved against the
launch working directory. Project memory always lives at
`<workspace>/.fiasco/memory/project/`. Memory is never written merely because a
run succeeded. When enabled, the resolved paths enter the initial reminder; the
model uses `read`, `write`, and `bash` directly, or delegates a large independent
update through an ordinary GeneralTask child.

## Web Search

```toml
[web_search]
enabled = true
api_key_env = "BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY"
endpoint = "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search"
default_count = 8
```

When enabled, the API key environment variable must exist at startup. Local
workspace search remains a `bash`/`rg` operation.

## MCP

Each `[mcp.<name>]` entry starts one stdio child process for the duration of the
job.

```toml
[mcp.github]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]

[mcp.github.env]
GITHUB_TOKEN = "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
```

Values written as `$NAME` or `${NAME}` are resolved from the fiasco process
environment. Other values are passed literally.

## Hooks

Hook commands run synchronously in the configured order, receive JSON on stdin,
and may emit `{"payload": ...}` on stdout for the next hook.

```toml
[hooks]
run_start = ["./scripts/run-start.sh"]
run_end = ["./scripts/run-end.sh"]
tool_before = []
tool_after = []
```

Hooks inherit fiasco's host permissions. A nonzero `run_start`,
`tool_before`, or `tool_after` exit fails that operation. `run_end` is a
best-effort post-commit notification: its failure is logged but cannot turn a
completed root or child activity back into resumable failed work and replay
earlier hook effects. For a reusable child, it runs after every successful
activity once the child is idle; explicit `task_close` does not invoke it.
