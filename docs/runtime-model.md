# Runtime Model

## Run

A run is one task executed by `AgentRunner`. Its durable lifetime is `open`,
`completed`, or `closed`: new roots and children are open, root success marks
completed, and explicit child closure marks closed. Active execution belongs
to the process-local handle state and filesystem lease; activity failures are
events and leave the run open for an explicit retry. `fiasco resume <run-id>`
continues an open root after repairing its message tail. The implementation
does not resume inside a provider stream or shell command. One per-run
execution lease prevents two processes from advancing the same trajectory
concurrently. Resume also requires the same non-secret provider
fingerprint: endpoint and wire protocol, plus provider-specific continuation
settings such as reasoning effort or Anthropic version. Credentials are never
part of that fingerprint. The run separately records its configured model
modalities and rejects resume when they change.

## Durable Messages

`run.json` declares `message_format` as `fiasco-message`. `messages.jsonl`
contains one complete provider-neutral message per line. Each record has its
run-local `m<N>` ref, timestamp, role, and typed content blocks. The blocks
directly represent runtime reminders, text, images, tool calls and results,
opaque provider continuation items, and background-task notices. Compatible
Chat reasoning is the optional assistant sibling `reasoning_content`. Tool
errors and `ArtifactRef` values remain attached to their result blocks.
Optional compaction state uses `_fiasco` on the same line.

This self-contained representation is not a provider wire format. OpenAI Chat,
OpenAI Responses, and Anthropic adapters project it independently. Keeping the
runtime representation directly avoids a second metadata log, byte-span
layout, duplicated sequence, and reconstruction hashes.

The run execution lease permits one writer and any number of read-only viewers.
A terminating newline makes that message visible immediately. A viewer may
therefore briefly show an assistant tool call before all result lines from the
same batch appear. A torn final line stays hidden. Before an existing run starts
another activity, the sole writer validates the complete lines, trims the torn
tail, and matches the trailing assistant tool calls against ordered results. If
any result is absent, it discards that assistant and its result prefix. Malformed
complete JSON, a noncanonical ref, or an impossible result order fails loading.
This pre-release contract does not decode older run-record versions.

## Loop

For each model step:

1. append newly ready background activity results to the current messages;
2. if compaction is enabled and the tracked usage threshold is reached, send
   the native older prefix plus one compaction user instruction, then append
   the instruction and assistant compacted state;
3. assemble the active context and send sorted tool schemas to the provider;
4. stream visible text and explicitly returned reasoning as separate events
   while collecting the complete response;
5. if the assistant is final, persist it as one complete message record;
6. otherwise execute its requested tools concurrently under one shared
   foreground window;
7. artifact large outputs, then append the assistant, complete tool messages in
   original call order, and optional user attachment message as one batch;
8. repeat, join outstanding background work before finalization, or write
   `final.md` when no tool calls or tasks remain.

On resume, complete messages remain. If the last assistant requested tools but
not every ordered result reached a complete line, that assistant and its result
prefix are discarded. A compaction request without its following state is inert
and excluded from active context. Fiasco appends a user/runtime reminder that
discarded work may have changed the workspace or external systems, and the model
must inspect state before retrying. It does not synthesize missing tool results
or automatically replay the turn.

## Compaction And History

Automatic local compaction is off unless `compaction.compact_at_tokens` is set.
That option controls compacted-state creation only: every agent profile has
both history tool schemas from its first call, and neither its system prompt nor
toolset changes when a compacted state appears. Fiasco estimates the system,
frozen schemas, and active messages before the first request, then adopts
provider-reported input usage whenever available. Between calls it estimates
new content adapters replay, including compatible Chat `reasoning_content` and
opaque provider continuation items. The compaction call uses the same provider,
model, system prompt, and frozen tool schemas, with a separate output limit and
one final user instruction. A tool-call or empty state emits a lifecycle event
and is retried once without execution; a request error or two invalid responses
leave the prior/full context in use. A fixed profile lacking either history
tool or both generic artifact
inspection tools (`read` and `bash`) would keep the full context instead of
compacting without exact retrieval.

Compaction does not mutate committed messages. After a successful response, it
appends the compaction user message and exact assistant compacted-state message;
each record's `_fiasco` state distinguishes control from ordinary conversation.
A request left without a state after a crash remains inert. Normal
context assembly excludes the compaction instruction and older compaction
records, using the initial runtime message, latest exact assistant state, one
synthetic user `<runtime-reminder>` that says to continue rather than compact
again, and exact recent ordinary messages. The reminder is provider context,
not another durable message. The omitted ordinary trajectory remains the source
for read-only recovery:

- `history_search` uses one Rust regex and returns newest matches only from the
  compacted prefix, including matches in linked full textual artifacts. Each
  match has an `m<N>` sequence ref, a `message` or `artifact` source, and a
  bounded snippet;
- `history_read` returns chronological Chat-compatible JSONL around that ref
  and preserves tool-call/result pairs.

There is no cursor. The configured search maximum omits older query matches;
refine the regex to reach them. If the already-bounded tool response is itself
too large for model context, the normal artifact envelope preserves that full
response. These are different truncation boundaries. Provider/server-side
compaction is not implemented. If configured, `context_window_tokens` rejects a
normal or compaction request whose estimated input plus configured output
allowance reaches the nominal full window. The provider-neutral estimate is not
a tokenizer-exact guarantee.

## Tool Results

Tool errors are returned to the model as error tool results instead of
immediately aborting the loop. Runtime/store/provider failures fail the run.
Image reads are complete artifact-backed results plus native model attachments.
The runtime places attachments after every paired result from the assistant's
tool-call batch. Text reads return at most 400 lines under a 65,536-byte cap;
if a multi-line selection hits that cap, the partial trailing line is omitted
and the truncation marker gives the exact next offset.
The initial runtime reminder states the current model's supported modalities.
When `image` is absent, an image `read` returns a model-visible tool error before
loading the file, creating an artifact, or attaching content.

## Delegated Agents

`delegate` starts a reusable general-task agent asynchronously. Its runtime
handle is the child run id. Children share the workspace, provider, and base
tools. The persisted `root` or `general_task` profile selects the model role.
Exact remaining delegation depth is the sole durable delegation authority, and
both profiles expose the same built-in schemas. The default maximum depth of
one gives the initial child zero remaining depth.

`delegate` accepts a non-empty display name and a self-contained prompt. Every child is
isolated: it starts with its own runtime reminder and delegated task, without
copying the parent conversation, compaction state, or artifact references.
The prompt must therefore include the complete objective and task-specific
context. The child uses the configured GeneralTask model and records a normal,
independent trajectory.

`inspect` returns a child's latest durable messages and can page backward by
sequence. `send_message` always requires `mode`. `steer`
queues a normal user message after the current complete assistant/tool batch;
`followup` waits for the current activity boundary. Neither mode interrupts a
tool batch, and an idle agent starts immediately in either mode. Activity
completion leaves the agent `idle`. `stop` interrupts only current activity;
`close` rejects new input, cancels and joins active work when necessary, clears
queued input, and then permanently closes the agent. `list_handles` discovers
all visible handles or inspects named handles; wait-any `wait` observes both
delegated agents and current-process tool jobs.

There is no durable parent-side handle record or pending-input log. On root
restart, active child work, tool jobs, queued followups, mailbox input, and
undelivered output from the prior process are discarded. The root receives an
unconditional crash reminder. `list_handles` discovers direct child runs by
parent id without launching them. The first explicit `send_message` to an old
open child adds a child crash reminder and starts a new activity from the
child's complete transcript. A closed child stays closed.

A status-less `<runtime_handle>` tool result means only that work is running.
At a later model boundary, ready activity outputs are grouped in one
`<runtime-reminder>` user message. Each result block includes its handle, kind,
name, and status. Its payload follows the ordinary per-result policy: small
UTF-8 text stays inline, while large or binary output uses the bounded
`[Tool output]` artifact envelope. The runtime block is added after payload
limiting and its text is XML-escaped, so status, artifact metadata, read
instructions, and closing tags cannot be clipped or forged by activity output.

The CLI resumes the parent, not a child id. Parent recovery never advances a
child automatically. Large memory updates use this same child path and need no
separate recovery case.

Resume has a process-domain precondition: the supervisor, cgroup, or container
has terminated the old fiasco process and all locally managed descendants.
A busy run lease is therefore an invariant violation, not a condition to poll.
Remote jobs and side effects outside that process tree may remain and are why
the restart reminder requires inspection.

Parent, child, and compaction requests share one model-call semaphore. Its
default capacity is one so a child can run against single-concurrency compatible
endpoints without racing the parent; deployments can raise it explicitly. Once
a call acquires a permit, the corresponding `model_started` or
`compaction_started` event is emitted and its hard request deadline covers the
entire provider call without resetting. Every started request closes with a
completed or failed event before the permit is released, so event order also
reflects the configured concurrency. A normal failure emits `model_failed`
before the enclosing `run_failed`; when a discarded incomplete response reports
usage, that failure retains its input, output, cached-input, and reasoning
counts. Each real compaction retry is a separate numbered attempt: invalid responses retain their reported input, output,
cached-input, and reasoning usage in `compaction_failed`, and a successful
`compaction_completed` carries the accepted attempt number. A compaction
rejected by the context-window preflight has no started event, a null attempt,
and no usage because no provider request occurred. Waiting for a permit does
not emit a started event. A separate stream-idle interval covers response
headers and the request opening that precedes them, then restarts after every
valid SSE event, so a healthy long reasoning response can outlive one idle
interval. Neither timer includes later tool execution. An expired normal call
fails that run; an expired compaction call records `compaction_failed` and
continues with the uncompacted context.

If a provider explicitly reports a structurally incomplete normal response
(for example, an output-token stop or a stream ending without its terminal
event), fiasco discards that partial assistant content and makes one repair
request. The second request reuses the same system prompt, frozen tools, and
existing messages with one non-durable runtime reminder appended at the tail.
Each real request emits its own started/failed or started/completed lifecycle,
including provider-reported usage for the discarded attempt when available.
Transport, authentication, filtering/refusal, malformed SSE, deadline, and
other provider errors do not use this repair path.

## Streaming

Provider text deltas are transient `model_delta` runtime events. Explicit
reasoning deltas are separate transient `model_reasoning_delta` events, so live
sinks can choose whether to render them. `RunDirStore` does not write either
per-chunk event to `events.jsonl`; that file retains lifecycle, tool, artifact,
usage, and failure events for inspection and debugging. Only the complete
assistant message, including optional `reasoning_content`, enters
`messages.jsonl`, preventing partial or duplicated content after a crash.
Reasoning is not included in `final.md`.

## Prompt Stability

The normal agent's built-in system prompt is workspace-independent,
tool-agnostic, loaded from the embedded typed YAML registry, and invariant
across its calls. Sorted tool schemas form the other stable request prefix and
are frozen before the first call. Each schema owns its feature's workflow
guidance, so removing a capability also removes its prompting influence. Core
history schemas are included regardless of `compact_at_tokens`. Root
and GeneralTask receive identical built-in schemas, including delegation and
handle controls. Remaining delegation depth is runtime state; it appears in the
initial reminder and a zero-depth `delegate` call fails before task creation.
Optional web and MCP schemas depend on startup configuration. Memory adds
reminder paths, not a schema. A compaction call reuses the same stable prefix.

The first user message begins with a `<runtime-reminder>` text block containing
the workspace snapshot: path, `AGENTS.md`, sorted skill metadata, memory paths,
and stable GeneralTask guidance for a child. The original user request follows
after a blank line in the same ordinary Chat `content` string. YAML folds
source-only wrapping in built-in agent prompts; dynamic reminder inputs remain
exact.

Tool output, background results, and later complete messages append at the
durable conversation tail. Files or configuration changed during a run are
observed by the next run rather than rewriting the stored trajectory. When
enabled, the latest stored assistant compacted state replaces an older prefix
only in the projected provider context; the stored compaction instruction is
not replayed in normal requests. A synthetic runtime reminder immediately after
the state only identifies it as continuation context rather than a final answer
or another compaction request. The history tool manifests own their retrieval
guidance. Large results remain behind run-local attachment references; later
inspection observes the current file contents.
These choices reduce context growth and improve the opportunity for provider-side
prefix-cache reuse without coupling the loop to one cache API.
