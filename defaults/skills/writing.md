## Principles
- Lead with the conclusion, then explain
- One idea per paragraph
- Use active voice
- Cut filler words: "basically", "actually", "just", "really"

## Structure
- **Title** — what it is, not what it's about
- **Summary** — the key point in 1-2 sentences
- **Body** — organized by topic, not chronology
- **Examples** — concrete, minimal, runnable

## Technical Docs
- Start with the "why", then the "how"
- Code examples > prose explanations
- Keep code samples self-contained
- Document the gotchas, not just the happy path

## Formatting
- Use headers to create scannable structure
- Bullet points for lists of 3+
- Tables for comparisons
- Bold for key terms on first use
